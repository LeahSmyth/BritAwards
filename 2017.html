        <p>The winners of the 2017 BRIT awards were presented with one of five statues designed by the late Zaha Hadid. </p>
 
        <p>Hadid&rsquo;s vision was, being an architect, to focus efforts more on the 3D element, as the statue had previously been used as a canvas for artists to paint on for the last few years. The design expresses our unwavering optimism for the future and a break from the norm. The biggest challenge was to create something new within certain guidelines, yet achieving a result recognizable to the public.</p>
            
            <br>

        <p>The family of statues represents diversity and transition. The family of five trophies make up the 2017 BRIT awards statues, a concept designed to represent diversity. &ldquo;The family is connected by a wave of transition, they are different yet connected,&rdquo;.</p>
