<p class="artist-info">The winners of the 2017 BRIT awards were presented with one of five statues designed to "represent diversity" by the late Zaha Hadid.</p>
        
<p class="artist-info">The statuettes are a curved adaptation of Britannia – the female personification of Britain.</p>
    
<p class="artist-info">Hadid’s vision was, being an architect, to focus efforts more on the 3D element, as the statue had previously been used as a canvas for artists to paint on for the last few years. The design expresses our unwavering optimism for the future and a break from the norm. The biggest challenge was to create something new within certain guidelines, yet achieving a result recognizable to the public.</p>
    
<p class="artist-info">The family of statues represents diversity and transition. The family of five trophies make up the 2017 BRIT awards statues, a concept designed to represent diversity. “The family is connected by a wave of transition, they are different yet connected.”</p>
