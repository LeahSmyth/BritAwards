<p class="artist-info">British architect David Adjaye has designed the trophy for the winners of 2019 Brit Awards, which swaps the traditional hourglass for a figure with "unique" proportions. They take the form of Britannia, the female personification of Britain. But designed an alternative to the character's traditional slender form.</p>
        
<p class="artist-info">The trophies are cast in solid glass, finished with a translucent, frosty effect.</p>

 <p class="artist-info">"For me, designing the award was an opportunity to question and explore â€“ what is the nature of perfection and imperfection, what is the notion of beauty." </p>   
    
 <p class="artist-info">"David's treatment has surpassed my expectations, continuing the transformation of the award, as well as building on the legacy of outstanding creativity over the past few years," said Jason Iley, who is Brits chairman and CEO of Sony Music, and Alice Beal from Sony Music UK.</p>
