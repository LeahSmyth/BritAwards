<p class="artist-info">London-based artist Anish Kapoor has applied a sculptural approach, creating a blocky red trophy with the Brittania figure trapped in its centre for winners at 2018&rsquo;s Brit Awards.</p>
        
<p class="artist-info">His design sees Britannia – the female personification of Britain – trapped inside a transparent red-coloured block.</p>
    
<p class="artist-info">&ldquo;Sculpture is often a process of positive and negative form,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have made the award using both.&rdquo;</p>
    
<p class="artist-info">Kapoor is the first sculptor to design the trophy.</p>

<p class="artist-info">&ldquo;Anish has created some of the most adventurous and memorable works of our lifetime, which is reflected in the new Brit award,&rdquo; said Brit Awards chairman Jason Iley. &ldquo;He constantly pushes boundaries and challenges the norm and I love the way he has reimagined this year's award. The beauty of this award is that it challenges perspectives. Every which way you look at it, you discover more.&rdquo;</p>
