        <p>London-based artist Anish Kapoor has applied a sculptural approach, creating a blocky red trophy with the Brittania figure trapped in its centre for winners at 2018&rsquo;s Brit Awards.</p>
            
            <br>

        <p>&ldquo;Sculpture is often a process of positive and negative form,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have made the award using both.&rdquo;</p>
￼
        <p>Kapoor is the first sculptor to design the trophy.</p>
            
            <br>

        <p>&ldquo;Anish has created some of the most adventurous and memorable works of our lifetime, which is reflected in the new Brit award,&rdquo; said Brit Awards chairman Jason Iley. &ldquo;He constantly pushes boundaries and challenges the norm and I love the way he has reimagined this year's award. The beauty of this award is that it challenges perspectives. Every which way you look at it, you discover more.&rdquo;</p>
