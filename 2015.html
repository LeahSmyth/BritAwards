<p class="artist-info">The BRIT Awards 2015 trophy, styled by British artist Tracey Emin. The design features Emin’s trademark handwritten messaging as well as a large rosette which Emin describes as ‘slightly shieldish, but also like a pair of wings.’</p>
        
<p class="artist-info">On designing the statue, Emin said, “You want to do it really well. You don’t just want to decorate it, you want to make something that is really Tracey-ish, that is special for the people receiving it.”</p>
    
<p class="artist-info">&ldquo;BRITs Chairman Max Lousada said, “Tracey’s design is characteristically bold, brilliant, colourful and inventive - everything the BRITs stands for. We’re honoured to work with her and delighted to be able to celebrate the achievements of the BRIT Awards winners with such a unique and special trophy.”</p>
