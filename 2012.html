<p class="artist-name">Sir Peter Blake</p>
	
<p class="artist-info">Legendary Pop Artist, Sir Peter Blake designed the 2012 Brit Award continuing his long integration with the world of music and popular culture.</p>
        
<p class="artist-info">Blake’s design is typical of his work and perfectly captures the fun and Britishness of the awards. The statuette is patriotically coloured red, white and blue, echoing the union flag that appears, the word Brit and Blake’s classic pop art motifs that have become synonymous with his work.</p>
    
<p class="artist-info">“I am very proud to be 2012’s designer,” said Sir Peter. “It is wonderful to be a part of this most important and exciting music event, honouring the greatest of talents shaping our musical landscape. I’ve enjoyed the creative challenge to honour such leading performers enormously.”</p>
    
<p class="artist-info">David Joseph, Brits chairman, said the organisation felt hugely honoured that Sir Peter had agreed to take on the brief. Having created possibly the world’s most iconic album sleeve with The Beatles, Sir Peter’s work is synonymous with the best of British music.</p>
