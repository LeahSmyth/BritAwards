   <p>Artist Damien Hirst had 2013 Brit Award winners seeing spots before their eyes - after decorating the trophy with his signature design. Hirst has put his own stamp on the prize as the latest figure to stylise the figurine, adding the multicoloured dots which he has used in many of his well-known artworks.</p>
            
            <br>

    <p>His spots have been applied to numerous canvases and even a car over the years.</p>
            
            <br>

    <p>&ldquo;It has become such an iconic award, I love the Brits,&rdquo; he commented.</p>
            
            <br>
            
    <p>Brits chairman David Joseph said, &ldquo;Damien is truly one of the most important British artists and his reimagining of the statue will make winning a 2013 Brits an even more special proposition.&rdquo;</p>
