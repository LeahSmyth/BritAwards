    <p>Headwear guru Philip Treacy designed the 2014 Brit Awards trophies - and gave it a &lsquo;punk&rsquo; look.</p>
            
            <br>

    <p>Treacy said, &ldquo;Music has always been my inspiration and I&rsquo;m fortunate to have worked with some of the music industry&rsquo;s greatest artists. &ldquo;My inspiration for the trophy comes from a uniquely British genre of music, punk.&rdquo;</p>
            
            <br>

    <p>Brits chairman Christian Tattersfield said, &ldquo;Philip is renowned for his distinctive and memorable designs so we are thrilled to have him on board for this year. His involvement guarantees that the 2014 award will continue the tradition of iconic BRITs statues and we are pleased to be able to reward music creativity with something so unique and special.&rdquo;</p>
